   <h4 class="ap">AP.</h4> <p class="speech"> My dear sister, I don't envy you—though I remember when I
  did—but that was when I was a younger sun.  I don't think I'm
  quite well.  Perhaps a little change of air will do me good. I've
  a mind to show myself in London this winter. They'll be very glad
  to see me. No. I shan't go out today. I shall send them this
  fine, thick wholesome fog and they won't miss me.  It's the best
  substitute for a blazing sun—and like most substitutes, nothing
  at all like the real thing.</p>

 <p class="direction"> [Fog clears away and discovers the scene described. Hurried
  music. Mercury shoots up from behind precipice at the back of
  stage. He carries several parcels afterwards described.  He sits
  down, very much fatigued.]</p>

 <h4 class="mer"> MER.</h4><p class="speech">  Home at last. A nice time I've had of it.</p>

  <h4 class="dia">DIA.</h4> <p class="speech">You young scamp you've been out all night again. This is the
  third time you've been out this week.</p>

  <h4 class="mer">MER. </h4> <p class="speech">Well you're a nice one to blow me up for that.</p>
